Create a Banking System
## Problem#1
Create a Banking System, where a user can 
1) create a new account,
2) deposit money to a specific account,
3) withdraw money from a specific account,
4) check the balance of a specific account,
5) view the details of a specific account, and
6) view the details of all accounts.
  Each Account is identified by its account number, balance, and the name of the account holder. The system should be able to handle multiple accounts.
